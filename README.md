## Inspiration
  
We were motivated by the Users to see a widespread issue in health care: sharing routine updates with your primary care provider can be a terrible user experience. In order to create a reliable, approachable, and practical solution to keep track of your health, we wanted to use already existing technology and effortlessly combine them. Those suffering from one or more chronic conditions will find this to be extremely beneficial. 

## What it does?

When consumers are feeling unwell and want a hasslefree and cost effective way of sending reports to their doctor, <b>SyncFit</b> gives them a way to log their health situation. When you have an appointment with your healthcare provider, the user can use smart wearables to generate memos and share them with them. The memo's information is tailored to your health and what the doctor needs to know. As a result, your next meeting will be more fruitful and efficient because they will be able to inquire further and ask more better questions. Our app also offers many more services to allow our clients to lead a happy and healthy life, we offer an <b>Interactive Fun AI Yoga Trainer, Daily Fitness Recipies and Health Related Articles</b> to spread awareness about the need of exercise and good nutrition. We also provide a clean, modern and minimalistic approach to UI/UX to provide our users with a less bloated experience.
